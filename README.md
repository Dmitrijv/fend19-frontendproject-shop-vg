# Webshop - VG

![preview](/readme/framemePreview.png)

The purpose of this task is to extend the Webshop project with a user system that lets you register a new account, manage user details, order products without having to fill in a delivery form (if you are logged in), see your order history and restore your password. The system is written in PHP, JavaScript and uses a MySQL database to persist data.
